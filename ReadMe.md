# GUI-Tests

This repo is where I keep my development tests for various graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## Directory
* `/powershell_tests`
   * These are tests related to calling powershell scripts
* `/pyQt5_tests`
   * These are tests that create guis using the [PyQt toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt).
   * In this directory I'm working on interactive graphing functions, which allow the user to provide input and customize the charts.
* `/tkinter_tests`
   * These are tests that create guis using the [tkinter toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter).
